# Mobile Application Development Internship - CESI EXIA 4th Year

This GitHub repository holds the work done during my fourth year of Computer Science studies at CESI EXIA School as part of a mobile application development project.

## Project Context
During my fourth year at CESI EXIA, I completed an internship at an enterprise named KartLive Restauration, which operates in the karting, restaurant, and event venue industry. The objective of the internship was to create a mobile application that allows karting customers to make reservations and enjoy the restaurant services seamlessly.

## Repository Content
This repository includes the codebase developed for the mobile application during my internship. It comprises all the essential files for setting up and running the mobile app, including Ionic, AngularJS, TypeScript, Node.js, and Firebase specific files. For in-depth explanations about specific code segments, please refer to the documentation within the code.

## Team Members
- **Intern**: Abdeljalil HADJHABIB, responsible for the development and coordination of the project.

## Project Description
The aim of this project was to develop a mobile application that facilitates the reservation process for KartLive customers. By using the app, customers can authenticate, make reservations, and enjoy the restaurant services without any inconvenience. The application provides a user-friendly interface with access to menus, operating hours, and other essential details related to the restaurant, eliminating the need to rely solely on the Facebook page.

## Conclusion
This internship provided me with a valuable learning experience, as I acquired skills in a new programming language and explored the domain of mobile application development. Working on this project allowed me to contribute to a real-world application, and I am proud of the end productâ€”a modern, user-friendly app that caters to the needs of both customers and the company. This experience serves as an excellent example of my capabilities in mobile development and project management.
